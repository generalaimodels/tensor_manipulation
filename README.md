# Patch Processing API

This API provides a collection of image patch processing functions designed to perform various transformations, augmentations, and enhancements for tasks in image processing, machine learning, and computer vision. Each function targets specific image characteristics such as texture, frequency, noise, or gradient properties, enabling users to apply advanced patch-based filtering, transformation, and augmentation techniques.

## Features

- **Anisotropic Diffusion**  
  `anisotropic_diffusion_patch_filtering` - Applies anisotropic diffusion to smooth patches while preserving edges.

- **Autoregressive Patch Prediction**  
  `autoregressive_patch_prediction` - Predicts missing or altered patches based on autoregressive modeling.

- **Covariance Patch Whitening**  
  `covariance_patch_whitening` - Performs patch whitening by removing correlations in patch covariance.

- **Cross-Domain Random Permutation**  
  `cross_domain_random_permutation` - Randomly permutes patches across domains for robust feature generalization.

- **Entropy-Based Patch Swap**  
  `entropy_based_patch_swap` - Swaps patches based on entropy values to enhance texture diversity.

- **Directional Patch Gradient Swapping**  
  `directional_patch_gradient_swapping` - Swaps patches guided by gradient direction to focus on edge alignment.

- **Fourier Patch Mixing**  
  `fourier_patch_mixing` - Combines patches using Fourier transforms for frequency-domain blending.

- **Frequency-Aware Patch Scaling**  
  `frequency_aware_patch_scaling` - Scales patches with awareness of frequency components to maintain feature fidelity.

- **Frequency-Selective Patch Masking**  
  `frequency_selective_patch_masking` - Selectively masks patches based on frequency for feature isolation.

- **Gabor Filter Patch Augmentation**  
  `gabor_filter_patch_augmentation` - Applies Gabor filters to enhance texture and edge features.

- **Kurtosis-Based Patch Selection**  
  `kurtosis_based_patch_selection` - Selects patches based on kurtosis, emphasizing high-frequency details.

- **Laplacian Pyramid Blending**  
  `laplacian_pyramid_blending` - Blends patches using multi-scale Laplacian pyramids for seamless transitions.

- **Local Binary Pattern Encoding**  
  `apply_lbp_patch_encoding` - Encodes patches using Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for texture analysis.

- **MRF Patch Stitching**  
  `mrf_patch_stitching` - Uses Markov Random Fields for patch stitching, enhancing continuity.

- **Tensor Patch Mixer**  
  `TensorPatchMixer` - Mixes tensor-based patches for data augmentation and feature enrichment.

- **Random Gaussian Noise Addition**  
  `add_random_gaussian_noise_to_patches` - Adds random Gaussian noise to patches for data augmentation.

- **Stochastic Patch Replacement**  
  `stochastic_patch_replacement` - Replaces patches with stochastic variations to simulate randomness.

- **Temporal Patch Mixing**  
  `temporal_patch_mixing` - Mixes patches across temporal dimensions for dynamic sequence processing.

- **Texture-Based Patch Reorganization**  
  `texture_based_patch_reorganization` - Reorganizes patches based on texture features to enhance textural consistency.

- **Wavelet Patch Fusion**  
  `wavelet_patch_fusion` - Fuses patches using wavelet transforms for multi-resolution blending.

## Installation

To install, clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/generalaimodels/tensor_manipulation.git
cd tensor_manipulation

```

## Usage

Import the specific functions you need from the library:

```python
from tensor_manipulation import anisotropic_diffusion_patch_filtering
from tensor_manipulation import autoregressive_patch_prediction
# Create a sample tensor with shape (B, C, H, W)
batch_size = 2
channels = 3
height = 64
width = 64
tensor = torch.randn(batch_size, channels, height, width)
# Define patch size
patch_size = (16, 16)
# Apply anisotropic diffusion patch filtering
filtered_tensor = anisotropic_diffusion_patch_filtering(
    tensor, patch_size, eps=0.05, num_iterations=15, k=30.0
)
print(f"Original Tensor Shape: {tensor.shape}")
print(f"Filtered Tensor Shape: {filtered_tensor.shape}")
# and so on...
```

Use each function with patch data as per the documentation. Functions support various parameters for customization and control over patch transformations.
