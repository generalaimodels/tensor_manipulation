# tensor_manipulation
patch-processing functions for image and signal analysis, including anisotropic diffusion, autoregressive predictions, entropy-based swaps, frequency-aware scaling, and wavelet fusion. Each function enhances patch quality, with specialized methods like local binary pattern encoding, gabor filtering, and covariance whitening.
